I see! You want a step-by-step guide on how to **build** the website, **sonoaac garage**, based on all the features you mentioned. Here's a detailed instruction in 7 steps, outlining the specific tasks you need to complete:

---

### Step 1: **Setup Project Structure**

1. **Create a new folder** for your project (e.g., `sonoaac-garage`).
2. Inside this folder, create the following structure:

   * `index.html`: The main HTML file.
   * `styles.css`: The CSS file to style the site.
   * `script.ts`: The TypeScript file for the frontend logic.
   * `assets/`: Folder to store images and photos for the site.
   * `data/`: Folder to store any data or JSON files you might need (e.g., car makes/models).

### Step 2: **Design the Frontend (HTML and CSS)**

1. **Create the homepage (`index.html`)**:

   * Add a **header** section with the title **"sonoaac garage"**.
   * Create a **form** to collect car details from the user.

     * Form fields:

       1. **Make**: Dropdown list populated with car brands (e.g., Toyota, Honda, Ford, etc.).
       2. **Model**: Dropdown list that updates dynamically based on the selected make.
       3. **Year**: Input field or dropdown with years (e.g., 2000–2025).
       4. **Mileage**: Numeric input field for car mileage.
       5. **Condition**: Dropdown with options like "Great", "Good", "Fair", "Bad", "Non-Drivable".
       6. **Body Type**: Dropdown with options (e.g., Sedan, SUV, Truck).
       7. **Color**: Dropdown for car colors.
       8. **Transmission**: Checkbox to indicate if the car has a working transmission.
       9. **Catalytic Converter**: Checkbox to specify if the car still has one.
       10. **Photo Upload**: Option for users to upload photos of the car.

2. **Design the layout using `styles.css`**:

   * Make the form **responsive** to fit different screen sizes.
   * Add styles for the dropdowns, buttons, and input fields.
   * Ensure that the page has a **professional and clean** look, with a color scheme that reflects the branding of **sonoaac garage**.

### Step 3: **Implement Dynamic Model Loading (JavaScript/TypeScript)**

1. **Create a JavaScript function** that loads the correct **model options** based on the selected **make**:

   * Use a **JSON file** or **JavaScript object** to store the available models for each make.
   * Write a function that listens for changes in the **make** dropdown and updates the **model** dropdown accordingly.

   Example:

   ```typescript
   const makesToModels = {
     toyota: ['corolla', 'camry', 'rav4'],
     ford: ['f-150', 'mustang', 'explorer'],
     // Add more makes and models here
   };

   const makeSelect = document.getElementById('make') as HTMLSelectElement;
   const modelSelect = document.getElementById('model') as HTMLSelectElement;

   makeSelect.addEventListener('change', () => {
     const selectedMake = makeSelect.value;
     modelSelect.innerHTML = ''; // Clear existing options
     makesToModels[selectedMake].forEach(model => {
       const option = document.createElement('option');
       option.value = model;
       option.textContent = model;
       modelSelect.appendChild(option);
     });
   });
   ```

2. **Link the script to `index.html`**:

   * Add a `<script src="script.js"></script>` tag before the closing `</body>` tag.

### Step 4: **Car Valuation Logic (TypeScript)**

1. **Write the logic** to calculate the car’s value:

   * Create a function that:

     * Retrieves the **make**, **model**, **year**, **mileage**, **condition**, etc.
     * Applies the **37% deduction** for the initial offer.
     * Uses the **mileage** and **condition** to adjust the offer based on predefined rules.
     * Displays the calculated offer on the webpage.

   Example:

   ```typescript
   function calculateOffer() {
     const make = document.getElementById('make').value;
     const model = document.getElementById('model').value;
     const year = parseInt((document.getElementById('year') as HTMLInputElement).value);
     const mileage = parseInt((document.getElementById('mileage') as HTMLInputElement).value);
     const condition = (document.getElementById('condition') as HTMLSelectElement).value;

     // Example calculation logic
     let offer = getMarketPrice(make, model, year); // Function to get market price
     offer = offer * 0.63; // Subtract 37%

     // Adjust offer based on mileage and condition
     offer = adjustOfferBasedOnMileage(offer, mileage);
     offer = adjustOfferBasedOnCondition(offer, condition);

     document.getElementById('offer').textContent = `$${offer.toFixed(2)}`;
   }
   ```

### Step 5: **Add Photo Upload Feature**

1. **Implement a file upload input** in the form to allow users to upload photos of their car.

   * Use an `<input type="file" accept="image/*" id="photo-upload" />` field in your HTML.
2. **Handle the uploaded image** in TypeScript:

   * Allow the image to be displayed on the page after upload.
   * Optionally, allow users to upload multiple images.

   Example:

   ```typescript
   const uploadInput = document.getElementById('photo-upload') as HTMLInputElement;
   const preview = document.getElementById('photo-preview');

   uploadInput.addEventListener('change', (event) => {
     const file = uploadInput.files[0];
     const reader = new FileReader();
     
     reader.onloadend = () => {
       preview.src = reader.result as string;
     };
     if (file) {
       reader.readAsDataURL(file);
     }
   });
   ```

### Step 6: **Create Data File for Makes and Models**

1. **Create a `data/makes-and-models.json` file** that contains all possible car makes and their corresponding models:

   ```json
   {
     "toyota": ["corolla", "camry", "rav4"],
     "honda": ["accord", "civic", "cr-v"],
     "ford": ["f-150", "mustang", "explorer"],
     // Add more makes/models here
   }
   ```

2. Use **AJAX** or **Fetch API** to load this data dynamically into the JavaScript function that populates the **model dropdown**.

### Step 7: **Final Testing and Deployment**

1. **Test the site thoroughly**:

   * Test each form input for correct behavior (dropdowns, text fields, photo uploads).
   * Ensure that the valuation logic works properly and the offer is calculated correctly.
   * Check that the layout is responsive and looks good on various devices.
2. **Deploy the website**:

   * Once the site is tested and polished, deploy it using a service like **Netlify**, **Vercel**, or a web hosting provider.
